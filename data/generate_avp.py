"""
Deterministic generator for the synthetic Auth-Vuln-Patch (AVP) benchmark.

Synthetic benchmark release: the original AVP records are not published.
This dataset was generated from the paper's specification
(splits, statistics, label schema) to preserve the benchmark.

Paper: "Adversarially Robust Graph Neural Networks for Lateral-Movement
Detection in Enterprise Authentication Logs" (TIC 2026, Best Paper, Paper ID 734).

Spec sources: Section IV "THE AUTH-VULN-PATCH BENCHMARK" and Table II
(AVP BENCHMARK STATISTICS) of the manuscript.

Usage:
    python3 generate_avp.py --out-dir <dir>

Outputs:
    auth-vuln-patch-reconstructed-v1.jsonl   (2,847 incidents, one JSON object per line)
    avp-reconstructed-v1-summary.csv         (flat summary table)

Deterministic: fixed seed (734 = paper ID). Re-running produces byte-identical output.
