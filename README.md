**Adversarial robustness benchmark for Graph Neural Networks.**

A numpy-first evaluation harness implementing the attack suite and metrics
from the companion research on adversarial-robust GNNs
(**TIC 2026, Best Paper**, sole-authored). Compare GNN architectures on
equal footing: same threat model, same budgets, same metrics.

## Companion paper

**"Adversarially Robust Graph Neural Networks for Lateral-Movement
Detection in Enterprise Authentication Logs"**, 3rd IEEE Technology
Innovation Conference (TIC) 2026, Best Paper (Paper ID 734).
Published September 29, 2026: [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11703008) · DOI [10.1109/TIC68483.2026.11703008](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIC68483.2026.11703008).

> **Published abstract (IEEE Xplore, verified):** Lateral movement (LM) through enterprise authentication paths represents one of the most persistent and difficult-to-detect phases of advanced persistent threat (APT) operations. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for LM detection from authentication logs, yet their adversarial robustness against realistic living-off-the-land (LotL) evasion tactics remains critically understudied. We identify seven open research gaps through systematic literature analysis, with the absence of LotL-realistic adversarial benchmarks and the lack of continual learning for concept drift ranked highest in composite severity. To address these gaps, we present ROBGNN-LMD, a Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network with a LotL-realistic adversarial training framework derived from five MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique perturbation strategies. ROBGNN-LMD is evaluated on the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Unified Host & Network dataset and our newly released Auth-Vuln-Patch (AVP) benchmark of 2,847 labeled authentication incidents. ROBGNN-LMD achieves an F1-score of 95.1% on standard evaluation and 94.3% under adversarial perturbation - a 23.1-point improvement over the strongest baseline (LMDetect, 71.2%) - while maintaining a false-positive rate of only 2.9%.

> The published paper names the model **ROBGNN-LMD**; the metrics above (F1 95.1% standard / 94.3% adversarial, 2.9% FPR) are the ones to cite.

This repo is the runnable companion to that work: the same threat model
and metrics, packaged so anyone can evaluate their own GNN.

## Why

Graph Neural Networks are deployed in fraud detection, recommendation,
and knowledge graphs, all adversarial settings. Yet most GNN papers
report only clean accuracy. This benchmark makes robustness a
first-class, CI-enforceable property:

- **Two attack families**: PGD feature perturbation (L_inf) and
  structural edge-drop (uniform / high-degree)
- **Three metrics**: robust accuracy, attack success rate, and a
  randomized-smoothing certified-radius estimate
- **Zero heavy deps**: numpy + scipy only; torch optional, never required
- **CI gate**: `grbench evaluate` exits non-zero when a model is fragile

## Install

```bash
pip install gnn-robustness-benchmark
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anushamukka9/gnn-robustness-benchmark
cd gnn-robustness-benchmark
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart

```python
import numpy as np
from gnn_robustness.attacks import pgd_feature_attack, edge_drop_attack
from gnn_robustness.metrics import robust_accuracy, attack_success_rate

x_adv, log = pgd_feature_attack(features, labels, weights, epsilon=0.1, steps=20)
print("robust acc:", robust_accuracy(x_adv, labels, weights))
print("ASR:", attack_success_rate(features, x_adv, labels, weights))

adj_adv, drop_log = edge_drop_attack(adj, drop_fraction=0.1, strategy="high-degree")
print("edges dropped:", drop_log.perturbed_edges)
```

Or run the full suite from the CLI (`.npy`, `.npz`, or CSV inputs):

```bash
grbench evaluate \
  --adj data/adj.npy \
  --features data/features.npy \
  --labels data/labels.npy \
  --weights data/surrogate_weights.npy \
  --epsilon 0.1 --drop-fraction 0.1 --format json
```

See [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) for a self-contained
synthetic-graph demo.

## Method

Full protocol details (threat model, PGD hyperparameters, edge-drop
strategies, and the certified-radius estimator) are in
[`docs/METHOD.md`](docs/METHOD.md).

## Dataset: Auth-Vuln-Patch (synthetic v1.0)

> **Synthetic benchmark release. The original AVP records are not published;
> this dataset was generated from the paper's specification (splits, statistics,
> label schema) to preserve the benchmark. Statistics match Table II of the paper.**

**[Download: release avp-v1.0](https://github.com/anushamukka9/gnn-robustness-benchmark/releases/tag/avp-v1.0)**

Auth-Vuln-Patch (AVP) is the companion benchmark from the TIC 2026 Best
Paper: **2,847 labeled authentication incidents** for lateral-movement
detection, adversarially stratified by expert difficulty ratings (1–5).

| Split | Incidents | Unique CVEs | Avg hops | Mean difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| train | 1,980 | 312 | 7.4 | 2.1 |
| validation | 427 | 89 | 7.1 | 2.2 |
| test-standard | 300 | 74 | 7.8 | 2.0 |
| test-adversarial | 140 | 41 | 9.2 | 4.3 |

Each incident carries an authentication path graph (users/hosts with
features, timestamped auth-event edges), CVE/CWE identifiers, a
ground-truth remediation patch, MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique tags, and one
of five LotL perturbation strategies. Construction sources: LANL-derived
(1,243), MITRE Engenuity incident reports (904), LMDG synthetic (700,
spanning 14 LotL sub-technique variants). License: CC BY 4.0. Full
schema and provenance: [`data/DATASET_CARD.md`](data/DATASET_CARD.md),
[`data/DATA_PROVENANCE.md`](data/DATA_PROVENANCE.md).

```python
import json

with open("auth-vuln-patch-reconstructed-v1.jsonl") as f:
    incidents = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

adv = [i for i in incidents if i["split"] == "test-adversarial"]
print(len(incidents), "incidents |", len(adv), "adversarial test")
print(adv[0]["cve_id"], adv[0]["attck_tags"], adv[0]["perturbation_strategy"])
# -> CVE-2023-14795 ['T1078'] Noisy Decoy  (synthetic identifiers)

# Regenerate the dataset byte-identically from the paper spec:
#   python3 data/generate_avp.py --out-dir data
# Validate against Table II:
#   python3 data/validate_avp.py data/auth-vuln-patch-reconstructed-v1.jsonl
```
